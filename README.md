Go Task Manager
This is a simple task manager I built while learning the Go programming language.
It has a basic GUI where you can add, view, and delete tasks.
Tasks are saved in a local text file so they are still there when you reopen the app.

Features
Add new tasks

View all saved tasks

Delete completed tasks

Data is saved in stored_tasks.txt

Simple graphical interface

How to Run
Make sure you have Go installed.

Download or clone this project.

In the terminal, go to the project folder.

Run:
go mod tidy
go run main.go main_gui.go
The GUI will open, and you can start using it.

About
This is my first Go project.

It was made to practice basic Go syntax and GUI programming.

No database or internet connection is needed.
